        <h2>Understanding Climate Change</h2>
        <p>It’s more than just “the planet getting hotter.” Let’s break it down.</p> 
        <p>Climate change is what happens when the Earth’s normal weather patterns start to shift — big time. It’s mainly caused by humans burning fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and gas), which release greenhouse gases into the air. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, like a giant invisible blanket, making the planet warmer over time. 🥵</p>       
        <h3>But it’s not just about temperature. Climate change leads to:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>🔥 More wildfires</li>
            <li>🌪️ Stronger storms</li>
            <li>🌊 Rising sea levels</li>
            <li>🌾 Crops not growing properly</li>
            <li>🐧 Animals losing their homes</li>
          </p>And yeah, it sounds scary — but understanding it is the first step toward fixing it.
