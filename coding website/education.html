        <h2>Understanding Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities have been a primary driver of climate change since the 20th century.</p>
        
        <h3>The Dangers of Climate Change</h3>
        <p>Climate change poses a significant threat to our planet and future generations. Rising global temperatures lead to extreme weather events, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity. These changes disrupt ecosystems, threaten food security, and increase the frequency of natural disasters.</p>
